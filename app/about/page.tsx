            Blue Futures captures the sense of possibility held within the ocean's horizon — a future shaped by care, curiosity, and courage. It reflects the belief that the choices we make today can turn the deep blue into a source of renewal for generations to come. It is both a vision and an invitation: to imagine a world where our oceans thrive, and where our shared future is as vibrant and alive as the waters that sustain us.

            Over two days, we explore how we can create a regenerative Blue Economy—one that respects nature, fosters innovation, and connects communities across the world. Through dialogue, collaboration, and co-creation, we turn ideas into action, and action into hope.

      <Section title="The Ocean: Our Planet's Beating Heart" subtitle="Why this matters now">
        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-6">
          <p>
            The ocean is our planet's beating heart — a source of wonder, resilience, and life itself. It nourishes our communities, fuels our economies, stabilizes our climate, and connects every shore on Earth. Yet beneath its powerful tides lies a delicate world that depends on our care. In a time of rising challenges — from plastic pollution to disappearing species — choosing to protect the ocean is choosing to protect our shared future. When we safeguard its depth, we safeguard possibility, hope, and the generations who will inherit the blue world we leave behind.

            Young students are the architects of tomorrow, the next generation of leaders, innovators, and changemakers. This conference is their stage — a place where fresh ideas spark, bold visions take shape, and voices that will guide businesses, communities, and the world come together. Here, we do more than learn. We connect, imagine, and act, shaping the currents of a future full of possibilities that only we, students, can lead.

            The ocean is the lifeblood of our planet, touching every Sustainable Development Goal: it nourishes communities, fights poverty, drives clean energy, captures carbon, and powers a more just and thriving world. The Blue Economy is not a distant dream; it is rising now, through bold innovations: regenerative fisheries, renewable marine energy, and community-led conservation that restores life while creating opportunity.
