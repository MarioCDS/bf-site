        <p>Blue Futures is a community-powered conference hosted by oikos Lisbon at Nova SBE.
It brings together students, alumni, academics, businesses and policymakers to
protect our oceans and co-create a regenerative Blue Economy. The event unfolds
in two movements: first, a 4‑day oikos community retreat focused on leadership,
reflection and collaboration; then, an open conference welcoming a wider public for
dialogue, co‑creation and action.

By supporting ICC Lisbon 2026, partners don’t just fund an event — they invest in a
global movement that builds bridges across generations and sectors, with outcomes
that ripple far beyond the gathering.</p>
